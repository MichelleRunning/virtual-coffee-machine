# Virtual Coffee Machine

This is my **Coffee Machine Project** from the *100 Days of Code* Python Bootcamp.  
It simulates a coffee machine that can serve **espresso, latte, and cappuccino**.

## Features
- Check resources (water, milk, coffee, money)
- Make drinks based on user input
- Process coins and give change
- Track resources and money
- Report current resources

1. Run `main.py` in Python 3.
2. Type your choice: `espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`.
3. Insert coins when prompted.
4. Get your coffee and any change.
5. Type `report` to see current resources.
6. Type `off` to turn off the machine.
